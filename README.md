# KalmanFiltering
Sailing Robot Project(My part: Kalman filtering)

As a part of a sailing robot team I produced a Kalman filtering of diffent input information the sail 
receives and mapped it onto direction of movement calculations. TIt was used for navigating the ship towards the certain coordinates under different conditions such as: wind and its absens, waves.
