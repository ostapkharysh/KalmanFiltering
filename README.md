# KalmanFiltering
Sailing Robot Project(My part: Kalman filtering)

As a part of a sailing robot team I produced a Kalman filtering of diffent input information the sail 
receives and mapped it onto direction of movement calculations. They were used for navigating the ship towards the certain coordinates.
